# `/constr`

Project related design constraint files.

Good example are constraint files related with pinout or constraints related with PLLs safe clock startup.
If convenient use relevant subdirectories for constraint files grouping.
Do **not** put constraint files that are strictly associated with any particular module (aka. scoped to ref) here.
