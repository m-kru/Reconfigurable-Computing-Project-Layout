# `/scripts`

Scripts to perform various analysis, build, install, etc operations.

These scripts should keep the root level Makefile small and simple.
If project grows, and more and more scripts are added, one can group scripts them into relevant subdirectories.
For example, put `.tcl` scripts into `/tcl` subdirectory.
