# `/autogen`

Automatically generated files.

Files that are frequently automatically generated and are later used during build or run stage.
Do **not** put files that are generated once (or rarely) here.
For example, if one generates pinout constraint files using tools such as [fp2p](https://github.com/m-kru/fp2p), then one should put them into the `/constr` directory.
Whether to store this directory or certain files in the git is up to the user.
